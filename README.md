# Compsci220 Programming Methodology

# Assignments for CS220 at UMass Amherst
# Course Description:
## This course covers programming methodology for solving real-world problems using features of a modern programming language. The programming language that we will use for this class is Scala, although the techniques covered will be general to other imperative programming languages. We will take inspiration from robotics problems to cover examples of how to apply different programming design patterns and techniques to solve problems.
